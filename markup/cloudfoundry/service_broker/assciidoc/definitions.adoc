|description|A short description of the service that will appear in the catalog.|false|string|
|bindable|Whether the service can be bound to applications.|false|boolean|
|tags|Tags provide a flexible mechanism to expose a classification, attribute, or base technology of a service, enabling equivalent services to be swapped out without changes to dependent logic in applications, buildpacks, or other services. E.g. mysql, relational, redis, key-value, caching, messaging, amqp.
